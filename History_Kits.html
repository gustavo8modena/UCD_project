                <h2>19th and Early 20th Century - The First Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early days, football was anything but practical. Back in the 19th century, players wore
                    almost
                    formal outfits: long shorts, belts, thick socks, heavy boots with wooden studs, and oversized cotton
                    shirts that could weigh nearly 1 kg. Since uniforms weren't standardized, it was common for teams to
                    get
                    confused on the field — hats, scarves, or sashes were often used to tell them apart.
                    The game started to organize itself in British schools in the 1800s. Rules were drafted in Cambridge
                    in
                    1848 and officially consolidated in 1863, when handling the ball was banned and uniforms began to
                    take
                    shape.
                    By the 1870s, shirts were usually plain and single-colored, while shorts were almost always white.
                    With
                    the rise of professionalism and ticketed matches, clubs began to invest in their own kits, colors,
                    and
                    badges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As football became more professional, kits evolved slowly. Buttons were replaced by laces, heavy
                    cotton
                    gave way to lighter fabrics, crests were stitched on, and numbers appeared on the back. Cotton,
                    however,
                    remained dominant until the 1980s, meaning shirts soaked up sweat and grew heavy especially under
                    the
                    heat, when darker colors could even hurt performance.

                <p>
                    The 1986 World Cup marked a turning point: polyester became the global standard. Light, shiny, and
                    perfect for printing, it transformed shirts into more comfortable and durable gear and also into
                    advertising space. By the 1990s, especially at the 1994 World Cup, kits grew bolder and more
                    colorful.
                    Yet, they still trapped sweat and heat, proving there was room for innovation.

                <p>
                    By the early 2000s, new fabrics like Dry Fit changed the game once again. Shirts became lighter,
                    breathable, and performance-driven. Clubs also began experimenting with recycled materials, gradient
                    designs, and retro reissues. A football shirt was no longer just a uniform, it had become fashion,
                    cultural identity, and even a collector's item.
                    Today, clubs release two versions: “authentic” shirts, engineered for players' performance, and
                    “supporters” editions, made for the stands. Special anniversary kits and retro designs also keep the
                    tradition alive.
