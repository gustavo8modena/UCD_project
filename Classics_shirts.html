            <h1>World History of Football Shirts</h1>
            <h2>19th Century and Early 20th Century - The Beginnings</h2>

            <p>
                In the 19th century, playing football required heavy and impractical clothing: long shorts, thick socks,
                boots with wooden studs, and oversized cotton shirts weighing nearly 1 kg. Uniforms were improvised and
                often caused confusion between teams, so players used hats, scarves, or sashes to distinguish
                themselves.
                The formalization of rules in Cambridge (1848) and the creation of the Football Association (1863)
                marked the first efforts to standardize kits. Until the 1870s, shirts were usually a single color and
                shorts were generally white. With professionalization, clubs started investing in colors, crests, and
                visual identity.
                The Uruguay team of 1950, World Cup champions, wore a simple uniform without sponsors, which became a
                symbol of their historic victory.
                The Celtic team of 1967, European champions, became an icon of Scottish football with its green and
                white stripes, supplied by Umbro. The classic style of the era reflected the tradition and visual
                identity of European clubs, which still had no sponsors on their uniforms.
            </p>

            <h2>70's and 80's - Professionalization and Historic Icons</h2>

            <p>
                The Brazil team of 1970, wearing the traditional canary yellow, maintaining the identity that had
                already conquered the world in previous World Cups.The Netherlands of 1974, with Johan Cruyff, presented
                a historic curiosity: Cruyff, with an individual Puma contract, wore a shirt missing one stripe while
                the rest of the team wore the Adidas standard, showing how athletes and brands already influenced kit
                design.
                The Italy team of 1982, supplied by Adidas, won the World Cup in Spain with its elegant blue shirt.
                The Argentina team of 1986, provided by Le Coq Sportif, immortalized its shirt in Maradona's historic
                plays, including the famous “La mano de Dios”.
                The Germany team of 1990, wearing Adidas, introduced an innovative geometric design that became a style
                reference.
            </p>

            <h2>90's - Creativity, Sponsorships, and Iconic Kits</h2>

            <p>
                In the 1990s, kits became more creative, colorful, and visually distinctive, reflecting the rise of
                polyester, the introduction of sponsors, and the influence of suppliers. The Denmark team of 1992,
                dressed by Hummel, surprised the world by winning the European Championship, while clubs such as
                Fiorentina in 1998 and Scotland in the same year established iconic, recognizable designs.
                The Mexico team of 1998 innovated with the Aztec Sun Stone in the background, quickly becoming a
                collector's favorite. In Brazil, São Paulo 1992 maintained its classic tricolor, while Juventude of
                1999, with uniforms supplied by Umbro, celebrated the club's first ever Copa do Brasil victory.

            <h2>2000's - Technology, Fashion, and New Icons</h2>

            <p>Barcelona 2005 (Nike) and Liverpool 2005 (Reebok) marked the start of the 21st century with memorable
                achievements and kits that became modern football icons. Real Madrid 2014 (Adidas) and France 2018
                (Nike) consolidated technological advances, with lightweight fabrics, strategic ventilation, and designs
                balancing performance and aesthetics.</p>
